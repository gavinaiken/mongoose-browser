# mongoose-browser

Making the browser-compatible version of mongoosejs available through Github, to allow simpler consumption through jspm.

See http://mongoosejs.com/docs/browser.html for details of what is possible with mongoose in the browser.

This is nothing more than a simple mirror of the browser version available at thttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Automattic/mongoose/4.4.14/bin/mongoose.js
